## Creating Gig Images

The `images-html/` directory contains HTML files that generate professional gig visuals. These can be opened in a browser and captured as screenshots.

### Why HTML for Images?

- **Easy editing:** Modify text, colors, and layout with simple HTML/CSS
- **Pixel-perfect:** Consistent sizing and alignment
- **Version control:** Track changes to visual designs
- **No design software needed:** Works in any browser
- **Export:** Take screenshots for Fiverr upload

### Image Requirements (Fiverr)

- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Recommended Size:** **1280px × 752px** (optimal aspect ratio for Fiverr)
- **Minimum Size:** 550px width, 370px height
- **Aspect Ratio:** Approximately 1.7:1 (1280:752)
- **File Size:** Under 5MB per image
- **Quantity:** 3 images required, up to 5 total

**IMPORTANT:** All HTML image templates are designed with 1280px × 752px dimensions for consistency and optimal display on Fiverr.

## Best Practices for HTML Image Generation

Based on iterative development and testing, follow these guidelines when creating or modifying HTML-based gig images:

### 1. Fixed Dimensions (Critical)
```css
.card {
    width: 1280px;
    height: 752px;  /* MUST be fixed, not auto */
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
- **Always set fixed height** - Don't rely on `flex: 1` alone
- Use `overflow: hidden` to prevent content spilling out
- Test in browser at 100% zoom to verify exact dimensions

### 2. Layout Structure
```css
/* Recommended structure */
.card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.header { /* Fixed height section */ }
.main-content { flex: 1; } /* Flexible middle section */
.footer { /* Fixed height section */ }
```
- Use flexbox for predictable vertical distribution
- Middle content gets `flex: 1` to fill available space
- Header and footer have explicit padding

### 3. Content Fitting Strategy

**If content doesn't fit, reduce in this order:**
1. **Padding/margins** (20px → 18px → 15px → 12px)
2. **Gaps between elements** (30px → 25px → 20px → 15px)
3. **Font sizes** (32px → 28px → 24px)
4. **Icon sizes** (48px → 40px → 36px → 32px)
5. **Remove content** (only as last resort)

**Progressive reduction example:**
```css
/* First attempt */
padding: 40px;
gap: 30px;
font-size: 32px;

/* If doesn't fit, reduce incrementally */
padding: 30px;
gap: 25px;
font-size: 28px;

/* Still doesn't fit, reduce more */
padding: 25px;
gap: 20px;
font-size: 24px;
```

### 4. Grid Layouts for Content

Use CSS Grid for organized, responsive sections:
```css
/* Tech stack - 3 columns */
.tech-stack {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 20px;
}

/* Features - 5 columns in single row */
.features {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
    gap: 18px;
}
```
- Equal column distribution with `1fr`
- Adjust gap to control spacing
- Change column count to fit content

### 5. Typography Sizing Guidelines

**Headers:**
- H1 (Main title): 28-36px
- H2 (Section headers): 20-26px
- Paragraph/Subtitle: 14-18px

**Content:**
- Card titles: 16-20px
- Body text: 14-16px
- Small text/labels: 12-14px

**Icons:**
- Large (headers): 36-48px
- Medium (cards): 28-36px
- Small (inline): 18-24px

### 6. Testing Checklist

Before finalizing any gig image:
- [ ] Open HTML file in browser
- [ ] Verify dimensions: Right-click → Inspect → Check computed width/height
- [ ] Check all content is visible (no scrolling needed)
- [ ] Test at 100% browser zoom
- [ ] Take screenshot at exact 1280x752 resolution
- [ ] Verify file size < 5MB

### 7. Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Content overflows bottom of card
- **Solution:** Reduce main-content padding and gap between sections

**Issue:** Cards look cramped
- **Solution:** Reduce number of items or use smaller font sizes

**Issue:** Text wrapping unexpectedly
- **Solution:** Reduce font size or shorten text content

**Issue:** Sections not aligned properly
- **Solution:** Use `flex: 1` on middle section, fixed padding on header/footer

### 8. Design Principles

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. Header (most important) - bold colors, larger text
2. Main content (focus area) - clean layout, organized sections
3. Footer/stats (supporting info) - smaller, complementary

**Color Guidelines:**
- **Primary:** Deep blues (#1a237e, #283593) for headers
- **Accent:** Green (#4CAF50, #27c93f) for highlights/success
- **Background:** Light grays (#f8f9fa, #e9ecef) for cards
- **Text:** Dark gray (#333) for readability on light backgrounds

**Spacing Rules:**
- Maintain consistent gaps (multiples of 4-5px: 12px, 16px, 20px, 25px)
- Use more padding for important sections
- Balance whitespace to avoid crowding

### 9. Accessibility Considerations

- **Contrast:** Ensure text has sufficient contrast with background
- **Font size:** Minimum 12px for readability
- **Icon + text:** Always pair icons with descriptive text
- **Color coding:** Use colors consistently across all images

### 10. Performance Tips

- Minimize CSS animations for screenshot (or disable with comments)
- Use system fonts for faster rendering
- Avoid external dependencies (images, fonts, libraries)
- Keep inline CSS for portability

### Current Images Status

- ✅ **Image 1:** Professional gig cover (`fiverr-gig-cover.html`)
- ✅ **Image 2:** Portfolio showcase (`fiverr-gig-image-2-clean.html`)
- ✅ **Image 3:** Technology stack visual (`fiverr-gig-image-3-tech-stack.html`)

## How to Use

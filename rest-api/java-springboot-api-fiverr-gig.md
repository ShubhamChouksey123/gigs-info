## 3.2 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

### Q1: Do I need technical knowledge to use your API?
**A:** Not at all! I provide comprehensive documentation with examples, Postman collections for testing, and step-by-step deployment guides. The API follows REST standards making it easy to integrate with any frontend framework. I also offer video tutorials and 1-on-1 support calls if needed.

### Q2: Can you integrate with my existing frontend or mobile app?
**A:** Absolutely! My REST APIs are platform-agnostic and work perfectly with React, Angular, Vue, Flutter, React Native, iOS, Android, or any technology that makes HTTP requests. I configure CORS properly and provide integration examples for popular frameworks.

### Q3: What if I need changes or additional features later?
**A:** All packages include revisions (2-unlimited based on tier). After delivery, you can order additional endpoints at $8 each, or message me for custom modifications. Premium package includes 60 days of support for any clarifications or small adjustments.

### Q4: How do you ensure my API is secure?
**A:** Security is my top priority! I implement Spring Security with JWT tokens, input validation, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention, rate limiting, password encryption (BCrypt), and follow OWASP best practices. Premium package includes security audit and penetration testing recommendations.

### Q5: Will the API handle high traffic and scale well?
**A:** Yes! I optimize for performance with database indexing, connection pooling, efficient queries, caching (Redis), and async processing where needed. The Premium package includes load testing and can handle thousands of concurrent requests. Cloud deployment ensures horizontal scaling capability.

### Q6: What about deployment and hosting?
**A:** I provide complete deployment guides for local, Docker, and cloud environments. Standard package includes Docker setup. Premium package includes full OCI/AWS deployment with custom domain, SSL certificates, and monitoring setup. Free consultation on hosting options included!

### Q7: Do you provide database design or use my existing database?
**A:** Both! I can design a new optimized database schema from scratch OR integrate with your existing database. I create ER diagrams, implement migrations, add proper indexes, and ensure data integrity with foreign keys and constraints.

### Q8: Why are your prices higher than some other sellers?
**A:** You're paying for production-proven expertise, not tutorial-level code. My live application (http://161.118.188.237:8080) serves real users with 100% uptime. You get enterprise-grade security, comprehensive testing, proper documentation, and code that won't break when your business grows. Quality saves money long-term!

### 6. PROJECT DESCRIPTION (1400 characters max)

**Full-stack restaurant digital menu management system** built for Bapu Ki Kutia vegetarian restaurant, featuring 126 dishes across 16 categories. This solution transforms traditional dining by eliminating physical menus, reducing printing costs, and enabling instant menu updates.

The **responsive web application** serves as a contactless digital menu accessible via QR codes, providing interactive search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, and automatic bill generation. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, the mobile-first frontend includes a photo gallery, Google Maps integration, dish ratings, and localStorage for cart persistence ensuring seamless browsing experience.

The **Spring Boot 3.2 REST API backend leverages Java 21, Spring Security, and JWT authentication** for secure admin access. The React 18 admin dashboard enables restaurant staff to instantly update dish availability, prices, descriptions, and categories without technical knowledge. Database-driven architecture ensures data consistency and supports multi-location scalability.

**Technology stack**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.2, Spring Security, JWT, Hibernate JPA, Maven, React 18, Vite, JavaScript ES6+, HTML5, CSS3, RESTful API architecture, responsive design, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure deployment. Demonstrates clean code principles, comprehensive documentation, and production-ready architecture serving real customers.

**From paper to pixels‚Äîtransforming restaurant operations one QR code at a time.**

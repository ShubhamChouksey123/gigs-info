**A:** Yes! I set up free hosting on GitHub Pages with unlimited bandwidth and 99.9% uptime. No monthly fees, no hidden costs. For Premium packages, I also offer OCI deployment with custom domain configuration.

**A:** No app required! It's a mobile-responsive website that works perfectly in any browser. Customers simply scan the QR code with their phone camera and the menu opens instantly in their browser.
